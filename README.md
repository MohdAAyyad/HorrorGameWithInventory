# Project Cursed
I am developing a 2D thriller which incorporates an inventory system. The inventory system consists of three components:
- A Dictionary object which acts as the game’s database containing all the different items.
- A List of Item Objects which represent the items currently in the player’s possession.
- And an Item class which contains values that determine the capability of an item. 

Players needs to use the items they find to go through the levels while also running away from the monster which appears at certain pre-determined sections of the levels. 

I also add a personal design challenge to all the games I make, for this one, the challenge is to make what is essentially a platformer, but with no jumping ability.

To be added to this GitHub directory soon:

- Stamina management system for the player so that she cannot run indefinitely.
- A fully playable demo.
