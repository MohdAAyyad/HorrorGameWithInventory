# HorrorGameWithInventory
Project Cursed

I am developing a 2D thriller which incorporates an inventory system. 
The inventory system consists of three components: 
- A Dictionary object which acts as the game’s database containing all the different items. 
- A List of Item Objects which represent the items currently in the player’s possession. 
- And an Item class which contains values that determine the capability of an item. 

I also add a personal design challenge to all the games I make, for this one, the challenge is to make what is 
essentially a platformer, but with no jumping ability.

To be added soon to this GitHub directory soon:

- Stamina management system for the player so that she cannot run indefinitely.
- A fully playable demo.
